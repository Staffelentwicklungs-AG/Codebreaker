# Codebreaker<br/>
This game prototype was developed as part of a weekly student project within a game development training program. Each student group explores a different core mechanic inspired by modern AAA games but scaled down to fit a beginner-friendly scope using the Unity Engine (2D or 3D).<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to help students learn essential development workflows such as:<br/>
  -Scripting<br/>
  -Scene building<br/>
  -Asset integration<br/>
  -UI and UX basics<br/>
  -Simple game logic<br/>
<br/>
Each prototype features a unique gameplay twist (USP) and focuses on one specific mechanic or idea.<br/>
Inspired by: Watch Dogs / Cyberpunk 2077 / FNAF<br/>
Genre: 2D Puzzle / Point and Click<br/>
USP: Activate nodes in the correct sequence to "hack" a system before time runs out.<br/>
Main focus: Puzzle flow, logic chains, visual feedback.<br/>

Core Gameplay:<br/>
Switch between different computer / displays to solve all kinds of puzzles (minigames) in order to 'hack'<br/>
Activate nodes in the correct order<br/>
Each node has specific conditions (e.g. must follow another node)<br/>
Limited time or moves per puzzle<br/>
Incorrect sequences trigger system errors or alarms<br/>

Mechanics:<br/>
Grid-based puzzle layout<br/>

Multiple node types:<br/> 
 Power Node – provides energy<br/> 
 Gate Node – requires multiple inputs<br/> 
 Logic Node – performs AND/OR/NOT functions<br/> 
 Trap Node – triggers alarm if activated incorrectly<br/> 
 Switch/Rotator – redirects connections dynamically<br/>

Visual connections show energy/data flow in real-time<br/>


Unique Selling Points (USP):<br/>
Smooth visual feedback (glowing lines, node color shifts)<br/>
Increasingly complex logic chains<br/>
Immersive cyberpunk atmosphere (sound design, glitch FX, neon UI)<br/>
Level structure includes short missions and larger story-driven systems<br/>


Story (optional):<br/> 
You are a "Neuro-Runner" infiltrating digital systems for a rebel network. As you dive deeper into the net, firewalls grow stronger and digital defenses smarter – adding layers of challenge and tension.<br/>

Minigames (puzzles):<br/>
Minigames can appear on different monitor, you have to check every monitor and hack your way through<br/>
Pop-up game: One of many minigames. you fucked up big time. As a result a bunch of errors occurred, close all windows in the given time.<br/>
password game: Lines of "machine code" appear (only 1 and 0), look for the incorrect numbers and write them down in the correct order to get the password<br/>
file game: "snake" like controls, connect the wire to the corresponding file</br>
wire game: remove the right cables<br/>
frirewall game: random generated word appear, type as as fast as possible without typos to get past the firewall</br> 
virus game: Start a cyber attack, oh no you need the virus thats on your usb stickk. Plug it in your PC. Wait it doesnt fit, rotate it and try again, it's wrong again. Rotate it a another time, weird now it works. (takes always at least 3 times)<br/>

Target Audience:<br/>
Puzzle and logic lovers<br/>
Sci-fi and cyberpunk enthusiasts<br/>
Players who enjoy fast-paced, visually satisfying problem-solving<br/>
